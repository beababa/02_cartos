## Construction matrice distance entre wp et photo

Pour chaque wp, la distance entre date wp et date photo


```{r}
dist()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
